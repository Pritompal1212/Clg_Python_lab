#write a program to create a tuples (name,age,address,college) for at least two members and concatenate the tuples and print the concatenated tuple


# Create tuples for two members
member1 = ("Alice", 22, "123 Elm Street", "XYZ University")
member2 = ("Bob", 25, "456 Oak Avenue", "ABC College")

# Print the individual tuples
print("Member 1 Tuple:", member1)
print("Member 2 Tuple:", member2)

# Concatenate the tuples
concatenated_tuple = member1 + member2

# Print the concatenated tuple
print("Concatenated Tuple:", concatenated_tuple)
