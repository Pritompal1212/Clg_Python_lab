#write a python program to add and multiplycomplex number
#write a python program to print multiplication table of a given number

# Define two complex numbers
complex1 = complex(2, 3)  # 2 + 3i
complex2 = complex(4, 5)  # 4 + 5i

# Addition of complex numbers
addition = complex1 + complex2

# Multiplication of complex numbers
multiplication = complex1 * complex2

# Display results
print("Complex Number 1:", complex1)
print("Complex Number 2:", complex2)
print("Addition:", addition)
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)
